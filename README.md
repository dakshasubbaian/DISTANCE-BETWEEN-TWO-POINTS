# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Mention the coordinates as given
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula
### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,x2=10,4
y1,y2=6,2
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(round(d,2))
```
